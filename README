Welcome to makezone

makezone is a tool for automatic zone file maintenance and synchronization

It was originally developed by  Philip Hazel from Cambridge University 
(of Exim fame). 

We took it over for various internal uses in the mid-nineties, and finally 
added structured v6-support and various enhancements, as need arose.

Phil graciously permitted us to rerelease this version, since his own 
had not seen updates in a decade.
